# WebRTC Practice Example

This is a example build from Udemy course from `Marek Gryszkiewicz` called Create MERN Stack Video Chat Application. I highly recommend taking that if you wanna understand the working of WEBRTC.
I used it to learn and practice WEBRTC. I have added Typescript to the mix to make coding more fun and also converted server side to use ES module syntax.
